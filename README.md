# Phylogenetic-Analysis-of-Beta-Thalassemia-Variants-in-Asian-Populations-using-SVDQuartet

Given a high prevalence in South-Asian populations and some information about common SNPs found in these regions I was interested in unraveling the phylogeny of Î²-thalassemia variants. In this study, I conducted a phylogenetic analysis of SNP data, i.e. variants from chromosome 11, as made available by the 1000 Genomes Project to understand the evolution of  variants found in the beta-globin gene region. The phylogenetic analysis was performed using SVDQuartets as a part of the PAUP package run through command line interface. SVDQuartet is a phylogenetic analysis method used for multi-locus or SNP data using a coalescent-based model.

## Data Availability
As mentioned above, variant data was accessed from The 1000 Genomes Phase 3 release. 1000 Genomes is a database with reference genomic variations from a diverse group of populations. Asian Populations of Punjabi in Lahore, Pakistan; Sri Lankan Tamil in UK; Japanese in Tokyo, Japan; Han Chinese South and Han Chinese in Beijing; Kinh in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Bengali in Bangladesh; Gujarati Indians in Texas and Indian Telugus in UK (Indian immigrant populations) were used in this study. The Asian populations were chosen based on data availability from Phase 3 release. The populations included are given below in Table 1 and graphically visualized in Figure 1.  Five samples from each population were selected based on its availability through the tool described below, i.e. a total of 50 samples were chosen for this analysis.
